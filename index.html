                            Thus it is a fact that setting an aim and acting to achieve it is very important for a successful life. Everyone must start working towards it. Timely execution of an action plan with a proactive attitude is the key to success. One of the best ways to stay motivated is by visualizing the change and likewise by achieving step by step milestones.

                        <p> Physics, science that deals with the structure of matter and the interactions between the fundamental constituents of the observable universe. In the broadest sense, physics (from the Greek physikos) is concerned with all aspects of nature on both the macroscopic and submicroscopic levels. Its scope of study encompasses not only the behaviour of objects under the action of given forces but also the nature and origin of gravitational, electromagnetic, and nuclear force fields. Its ultimate objective is the formulation of a few comprehensive principles that bring together and explain all such disparate phenomena.  </p>

                            Remember, the vision is what you want to accomplish. Mission is a general statement of how you will achieve your vision. Strategies are a series of ways of using the mission to achieve the vision. Goals are statements of what needs to be accomplished to implement the strategy
                            Many skills and abilities separate effective strategic leaders like Howard Schultz from poor strategic leaders. One of them is the ability to inspire employees to work hard to improve their organization’s performance. Effective strategic leaders are able to convince employees to embrace lofty ambitions and move the organization forward. In contrast, poor strategic leaders struggle to rally their people and channel their collective energy in a positive, focused direction.
                            This brief but powerful statement emphasizes several aims that are important to Google, including excellence in customer service, and setting high standards for employees and Google’s products. McDonald’s brand mission is “to be our customers’ favourite place and way to eat. Our worldwide operations are aligned around a global strategy called the Plan to Win, which centre on an exceptional customer experience – People, Products, Place, Price and Promotion. We are committed to continuously improving our operations and enhancing our customers’ experience.”  To be effective, this mission statement must filter down to all employees and inspire them to adopt that mission.

                    Sir Isaac Newton PRS (25 December 1642 – 20 March 1726/27[a]) was an 
                        English mathematician, physicist, astronomer, theologian, and author 
                        (described in his own day as a "natural philosopher") who is widely 
                        recognised as one of the most influential scientists of all time and as
                         a key figure in the scientific revolution. His book Philosophiæ Naturalis 
                         Principia Mathematica (Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy), 
                         first published in 1687, established classical mechanics. Newton also 
                         made seminal contributions to optic
                        and shares credit with Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz for developing the infinitesimal calculus.

                was a German-born theoretical physicist[5] who developed the theory of relativity,
                 one of the two pillars of modern physics (alongside quantum mechanics).[3][6] 
                 His work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science.[7][8] 
                 He is best known to the general public for his mass–energy equivalence formula 
                 E = mc2, which has been dubbed "the world's most famous equation".[9] He received
                  the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics "for his services to theoretical physics, and 
                  especially for his discovery of the law of the
                photoelectric effect",[10] a pivotal step in the development of quantum theory.

               <p> 
                Galileo di Vincenzo Bonaiuti de' Galilei (Italian: [ɡaliˈlɛːo ɡaliˈlɛi]; 15 February 1564 – 8 January 1642) was an Italian astronomer, physicist and engineer, sometimes described as a polymath, from Pisa.[3] Galileo has been called the "father of observational astronomy",[4] the "father of modern physics",[5][6] the "father of the scientific method",[7] and the "father of modern science".[8]

                Galileo studied speed and velocity, gravity and free fall, the principle of relativity, inertia, projectile motion and also worked in applied science and technology, describing the properties of pendulums and "hydrostatic balances". He invented the thermoscope and various military compasses, and used the telescope for scientific observations of celestial objects. His contributions to observational 
                astronomy include the telescopic confirmation of the phases of Venus, the observation of the four largest satellites of Jupiter, the observation of Saturn's rings, and the analysis of sunspots.
